#Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Introduction:
This repository is dedicated to documenting the Requirement Analysis phase of a software development project. It focuses on identifying, gathering, and analyzing the requirements for a booking management system. The goal is to create a clear and structured blueprint that guides development, aligns with stakeholder needs, and ensures the success of the project.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of collecting, evaluating, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that everyone involved—developers, designers, and users—has a clear understanding of what the system should do before any code is written.

Importance in the SDLC:
- Clarity: Provides a clear vision of project goals and features.
- Risk Reduction: Identifies potential issues early to prevent costly mistakes.
- Guidance: Sets the foundation for design, development, and testing.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures the final software meets user expectations and business requirements.
